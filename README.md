# FarmEase

- FarmEase  is a machine learning-based project designed to provide predictions and recommendations for farmers. The system uses different algorithms to predict crops, recommend fertilizers, and provide rainfall and yield predictions to help farmers make informed decisions about their crops.
- IT also has direct crop sales to customer with real payment interface using Stripe API.
- Other supporting features are Chatbot using OPENAI's gpt-3.5-turbo model, Weather Forecast upto 4 days using Weather API, Agriculture realetd news using News API.
